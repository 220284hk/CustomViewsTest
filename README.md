# CustomViewsTest
This repository contains some basic code for custom views.

## Introduction
This app is for **practice purposes** only. 

## Design Systems
The purpose of design systems is ultimately for flexibility. By creating UI components in this manner (using custom views) it enables
teams to create projects which are more modular and hence scalable. New screens and functionality can be quickly developed by reusing 'blocks'
of code or developing new blocks via composition.
